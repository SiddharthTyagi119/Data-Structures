An array is a collection of elements of same type placed in a contiguous memory location.
Each integer takes 4 bytes.
Character array takes 1 byte.
If first address of memory is 100 then second address will be 104 and so on.
If an array has a size of 100(length) then indexing were start from 0-99.
You can acess ith location of array and can perform read , update ,output the data.

//CREATING ARRAY
1-Allocates a memory of 400 bytes and it is known as static memory allocation.
int a[100];

2-
Here {0} means initialization list of array and all the elements will store 0. 
int a[[100]={0};

3-
In this case,first three elements will be {1,2,3} and rest values will be 0.
int a[100]={1,2,3};

4-
In this, we have not define the size of array and it will be the size of initialization list elements.
inta[]={1,2,3};
